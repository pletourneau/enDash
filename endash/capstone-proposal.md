# Name of Project: Enphase Dashboard by Paul LeTourneau

## Project's Purpose or Goal: This dashboard will provide easy to information about a solar array with Enphase microinverters using the Enlighten API v4 (https://developer-v4.enphase.com/).

### For the user it will simplify the display when compared to the Enphase monitoring site. It will also allow them to share energy production to social media (stretch goal)

### For the client, a solar installer, it will allow for ease of contact in case of microinverter outage. It will also show their branding on the app AND social media posts. Lastly it will provide a low friction way for users to refer clients.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

<ul> 
<li> App will connect to Enphase API using OAuth 2.0 </li>
<li> App will pull and display data from API </li>
<li> Company branding will be sleek and small, yet prominent</li>
<li> User will have low friction ways to contact company via email for service/troubleshooting and referrals</li>
<li> Tokens will be stored SECURELY on the server side using express</li>
</ul>
## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
<ul>
<li> Built with React</li>

<li> Oauth 2.0</li>

<li> Express server</li>

<li> HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap</li>

</ul>
## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

### A way for the user to create a "brag" post on social media with installer branding. Possibly with referral links embedded.

### Embedded weather forecast through API

### Database for historical data to compare to current

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
